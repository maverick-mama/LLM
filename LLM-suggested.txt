?? Here's what I’d recommend:
1. Possible Site Navigation (based on the PDF’s messaging):
plaintext
Copy
Edit
Home
About
Grief Coaching / Services
Resources
Testimonials
Blog / Stories
Contact
2. Pages to Build:
Home: Emotional hook, tagline, CTA: "Find Support Today"

About Jennifer / Mission: Bio, vision, the "Love Like Matthew" story

Grief Coaching / Services: How she helps, what’s included, trauma-informed approach

Resources: Downloadables, articles, support networks, links

Testimonials: Quotes from those she’s helped

Blog / Stories: Personal stories, healing journeys, legacy posts

Contact: Email form, phone number, social links

?? Consider a Home Page Fade-In Animation:
Soft fade for logo and tagline:

css
Copy
Edit
.fade-in {
  animation: fadeIn 2s ease-in;
}
@keyframes fadeIn {
  from { opacity: 0; }
  to { opacity: 1; }
}
Sample header message:

“Your story is just beginning… let’s write the next chapter together.”

?? What You Can Do With This:
Build structure now using these assumptions

Drop in placeholders for content (e.g., "Awaiting final copy from client")

Send her a mockup + nav layout and say:

“Once I receive direction/content, I’ll finalize layout and flow. Here's what I'm working with based on the branding.”
