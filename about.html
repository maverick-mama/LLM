        <p>Grief Coach | Advocate | Author of “23”&nbsp;</p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;I am Jennifer Vinson—a mother, a survivor, and a guide for those navigating the complexities of loss. Following the tragic passing of my 23-year-old son, Matthew, due to a fentanyl overdose, and enduring the heartache of losing both my husband and father, I made a solemn promise: their lives would not be remembered in silence.
              
              Through my journey marked by childhood trauma, addiction, sobriety, and grief, I discovered healing through purpose. Today, as a certified grief coach, I assist others in traversing the darkest seasons of their lives. My mission, "Love Like Matthew," is a movement grounded in compassion, connection, and transformative change.
              
              I firmly believe in signs from above, the power of vulnerability, and the strength found within a community. My forthcoming book, 23, recounts my story with the hope of saving lives and dismantling the stigma surrounding addiction and grief.
              
              If you are coping with loss, know that you do not have to bear it alone. I am here to walk alongside you.</p>
